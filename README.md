# Readable Project

My submission for Udacity's React Native course. Users can use this app to aid them with revision. They can create decks
of cards and quiz themselves on the available cards. If the user has not completed a quiz for the day, they will get a 
notification prompting them to do so.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
.

### Tested Platforms

The app is currently unavailable. Expo SDK v25.0.0 is no longer supported.

### TODO

[ ] Upgrade to new version of the expo SDK

### Getting started

To run the app you must:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the expo app with `yarn start`
