# Readable Project

My submission for Udacity's React Native course. Users can use this app to aid them with revision. They can create decks of cards and quiz themselves on the available cards. If the user has not completed a quiz for the day, they will get a notification prompting them to do so.

## TL;DR

To run the app you must:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the expo app with `yarn start`
* start the iSO emulator with `i`

## Tested Platforms

This has been tested on the platforms:

* iOS emulator
